                mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their
                websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Physics Chat) are
                called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called
                "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided
                on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set
                these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and
                also when it visits certain other websites.</span></p>
            <p><b>Why do we use cookies?</b></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
                cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as
                "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
                interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
                through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail
                below.</span></p>
            <p><b>How can I control cookies?</b></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
                can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie
                Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
                cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner
                and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to
                some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web
                browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. </span></p>

            <p><b>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</b></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
                website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called
                "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that
                enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This
                allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to
                another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from
                an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure
                the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies
                to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</span></p>
            <p><b>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</b></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
                Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our
                services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can

                instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash
                Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed
                on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies
                that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</span></p>
            <p><span style="color:rgb(89, 89, 89)">Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
                acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications,
                including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online

                other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be
                interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
                advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about
                your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services
                of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them
