            <p><b><i>In Short:</i></b><i> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your

            <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store

              cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
            <p><b>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</b></p>
            <p><b><i>In Short: </i></b><i>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes

            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
              this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,

            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either

            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to

              to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
              can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
              other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
              steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
              transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access
              the Services within a secure environment.</p>

            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
              ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your

              recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
              browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
              online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
              about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

            <p>We do not process consumer's sensitive personal information.</p>
            <p>Verification process</p>
            <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person
              about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
              provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For
              instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
              that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may
              contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us.
              We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
            <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to
              make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
              purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
              maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
              your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
              information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
